## Quick Overview

💡 **Context** – IMIC (International Manufacturing International Contest) is an annual international competition<sup>[1](https://hal.science/EC-NANTES/hal-04770839v1)</sup> aimed at creating a benchmark.  
  In 2025, the proposed challenge was: **Flexibac**<sup>[2](https://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Benchmark-9-IMIC)</sup> --> <ins>Integrating a 6-axis robot into the Nantes postal sorting system</ins>

  <summary>More about the IMIC competition</summary>

  > Each year, a smart manufacturing problem is presented to participating universities worldwide.  
  > 1. Each university **proposes** a **solution**.  
  > 2. These solutions form a **benchmark** for the given problem.  
  > 3. The **best solution** is selected as the **reference**.  
  > 4. A **scientific paper** describing this solution is published.

🎯 **Goal** – Maximize the number of boxes processed by the robot, which involves:  
  1. Routing boxes to the robot or to human operators  
  2. Managing carts

🛠 **Design** of the solution with an MBSE approach (Model-Based Systems Engineering):  
  1. Requirements Engineering  
  2. System Architecture  
  3. System Modeling in AnyLogic

## Running the Simulation

1. Download the folder: `models/Anylogic_Modelisation/Flexibac`  
2. Install AnyLogic (version 8.9.4 or higher)  
3. Launch AnyLogic  
4. Open the AnyLogic file (`Ctrl+O` or File → Open): `Flexibac.alp`  
5. Run the simulation (`F5` or Model → Run)
